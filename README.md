# Time Altering Watch Product Website

**Note: This project is still incomplete, and work is in progress.**

This repository contains a product website that showcases a concept of a time-altering watch. This website helped me learn HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, i plan to add additional functionalities such as an appointment booking system and a payment gateway for prebooking the watch.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and mobile-friendly layout across different devices and screen sizes.

- **Product Showcase:** The website provides detailed information about the time-altering watch product, highlighting its unique features and benefits. It includes visually appealing images and engaging descriptions to captivate visitors.

- **Appointment Booking System (Work in Progress):** A functional appointment booking system is being developed to allow users to schedule appointments for product demonstrations or consultations. This feature will provide a seamless way for potential customers to interact and engage with the product.

- **Payment Gateway Integration (Work in Progress):** The website aims to integrate a payment gateway to enable users to prebook the time-altering watch. This functionality will allow customers to make secure online payments and reserve their spot to receive the product once it becomes available.
